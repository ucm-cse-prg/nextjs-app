## 🔧 Development Choices

### 🧠 State Management
**Library:** [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)
- Lightweight and unopinionated
- Ideal for global UI state like modals, themes, or user data
- Co-locates logic close to components for readability

### 🌐 API Communication
**Library:** [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)
- Easy-to-use promise-based HTTP client
- Supports interceptors for handling tokens and errors globally
- Organize API calls inside services/ for modularity

### 🔐 Authentication
**Library:** [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/)
- Full-featured auth with providers, credentials, or email
- Handles JWT or database session management
- Middleware support for protected routes and user roles

### ✅ Testing
**Tools:** [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) + [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
- Unit and integration testing framework for JavaScript and TypeScript
- Works well with Next.js, supports mocking and snapshots
- Test coverage reports and CI-friendly

### ⚡ Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- Use `getServerSideProps` for dynamic, SEO-friendly pages
- Combine with caching headers or revalidation when appropriate
- App Router encourages server components and co-located data logic

### 📱 PWA Support
**Tool:** [next-pwa](https://github.com/shadowwalker/next-pwa)
- Adds service worker and offline support
- Includes manifest.json for installability
- Easy configuration through `next.config.js`

### 🎨 Styling and UI Libraries
**Library:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) + [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/)
- Component styling via utility classes
- Easily customizable and responsive

### 📝 Forms and Validation
**Library:** [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
- Minimal re-renders and great performance
- Simple API for handling form state and validation
- Can be extended with schema-based validation (e.g., Zod) if needed

### 🚀 Performance Optimization
- Image optimization via `<Image>`
- Code-splitting via dynamic imports
- Lazy loading components as needed

### 📦 Deployment and CI/CD
**Platform:** Vercel, Netlify, AWS
- Git-based deployment pipelines
- GitHub Actions for automated testing, linting, and deployments
- Environment variable management included

### ⚙️ Configuration Management
- Use ``.env.*`` files for environment-specific variables
- Keep reusable config constants in `constants/`
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive or environment-dependent values

### 🔒 Security Features
- Secure cookies for authentication
- Middleware support for role-based access control
- Use `headers()` in `next.config.js` to set security headers like CSP, X-Frame-Options

### 🔁 Project Version Control
- Git with conventional commits
- Branching model: `main` for production, `dev` for active development

## 🧪 Example Commands

```bash
npm run dev             # Start dev server
npm run build           # Production build
npm run lint            # Lint the codebase
npm run test            # Run all tests
```
